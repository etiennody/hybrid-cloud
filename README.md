Udacity in collaboration with Nutanix

## Project 1 - Private Cloud Web Application Infrastructure

### Overview:

A fictitious company is called The E-Commerce Company.

After a failure in the datacenter, the CEO has demanded the IT team come up with a better solution to prepare and handle such failure events moving forward and mitigate the downtime it caused our customers. I am given the job to design a private cloud solution for the company’s key revenue generator, an e-commerce web application.

According to the CEO, all of the VMs must be protected against failure.

### Tasks:

Deploy and protect the three Virtual Machines composing the infrastructure for a web application on the private cloud: 
1. a web server VM.
2. an application VM.
3. a database server VM.

## Project 2 - Private Cloud Saas: Three-Tier Web Apllication

### Overview:

After the previous success demonstrating manual provisioning of VMs on a private cloud, the Vice President of Software Engineering has set your next project for on-premises private cloud automation. In order to make the software developers productive, I am tasked to provide a rudimentary working model of The E-Commerce Company’s basic web site on the private cloud in order to save on public cloud costs for test and development workloads.

### Tasks:

1. Design a blueprint to deploy and configure a three-tier web application with a load balancer, web server, and database VM hosted on the private cloud.
2. Insure each VM is configured with the proper resources and tasks.
3. Test the deployment works with a read and write to the database.
4. Test web tier scaling: scale-in and scale-out actions changing the population by a count of 1.
5. Allow an end-user to make a database backup.

## Project 3 - Hybrid Cloud Saas: Three-Tier Web Apllication

### Overview:

After the success making the software developers productive on the private cloud with the "Private Cloud SaaS: Three-Tier Web Application" project, I am now tasked with extending the model of the E-Commerce Company’s basic web application to a hybrid cloud deployment, in order to maximize high availability and scalable performance. In addition, I am tasked with creating small and medium deployment scenarios.

### Tasks:

1. Design a blueprint to deploy and configure a three tier web application with a load balancer hosted on the private cloud, two web server tiers (each hosted on a private and a public cloud), and database VM hosted on the public cloud.
2. Insure each VM in configured with the proper resources and tasks
3. Test the deployment works with a read and write to the database.
4. Test web tier scaling: scale-in and scale-out actions changing the population by a count of 1 on private cloud separately from scaling on the public cloud.
5. Allow self-service, ad-hoc backup of the database.
6. Create two application profiles for deployment for a small (1 vCPU, 1 core, 1GB RAM or t2.micro) and medium (2vCPU, 2 cores, 1GB RAM or t2.micro) CPU and memory configuration variants.
